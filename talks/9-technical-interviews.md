# What They Don't Tell You About Technical Interviews

By Fatima Taj

## Messages asking for referral

- "Hi, I found a position at Yelp. Could you refer me?":
  - Highly impersonal
  - No link to job posting, no resume attached
  - Provide all the necessary details: link to job posting, resume, primary email address
- "Hi...opportunities for me?"
  - Worse because you're expecting your referee to do the work for you
- "Hi...here is the link to the job posting..."
  - Slightly better, but it's missing your resume
  - You want to reduce the amount of back and forth your resume would need to do
- Best out of the lot

## Networking & Referrals: Reality Check

In this market, the usual networking strategies that you've seen taught/seen on social media might not work:

- Send out messages in bulk and you're bound to get some referrals.
- The reality is that even referrals aren't working in this market.

The reasons include:

- Referrals are being given out like hot c akes (referral bonuses can be very generous)
- Referrals aren't all that useful at the new grad level simply because there are very few people who have actually worked with you and can testify for your skills
- Candidates forget that referees are asked how they know the person they're referring: a random stranger on LinkedIn will hold less weight vs someone you actually worked with

Let's do some simple math

- A tech company receives 4000 applications for a new grad opening within 4 days
- Out of the 4000, assume 5% have referrals: that's 200 applicants!

DON'T

- Stop reducing networking = referral.
- You don't start networking once you need a job. You need to do it well in advance!
- Don't treat people like a means to an end. Establish a genuine connection.
- Keep the connection going, even after you find a job!
- Be prepared to be told 'NO'. A referee is perfectly within their rights to do so.

Final thoughts on networking:

- Find the strategy that works for you
  - Use a hybrid approach
  - Start with 1, pivot to another
- This is an unprecedented market. No one can provide you with a strategy with a 100% success rate

## Applying to Jobs

- Harness the power of LinkedIn, Glassdoor etc.
- Make it into a daily habit as opposed to applying in bulk
- Applying in bulk:
  - Not an efficient use of your time
  - You could miss out on some great opportunities
- Making it into a daily habit
  - Less mental pressure
- Timebox yourself

Typical Breakdown of Your Day

- Networking: 30 mins
- Applying to jobs: 30 - 45 mins

*Behavioral Interviews:*

- Create a Google doc and list all possible behavioral questions you could be asked. You'll find tonnes of lists online, in addition to searching for questions by company.
- Once you have a list, start writing outlines for each question.
- The point isn't to memorize, sound natural
- 30 minutes a day, 1 question

*Leetcode:*

- Pick any list of questions (blind 75/150, etc), and do 1 question every day.
- For easy problems, spend at most 30 mins per question
- For medium, up to 45 mins
- Once time is up, check the solution, write down what you didn't know, and move on.
- Keep a spreadsheet of the questions you've attempted. Write down the question prompt and the trick to the solution (sliding window, 2-pointer, etc).
- Review this list occasionally (at the end of each day, week, etc.) so the patterns start sinking in. This is called spaced repetition.

- In total, per day, this adds up to 4-ish hours
- Doable on weekends, but quite a stretch on weekdays.
- Structure your weekdays differently from weekends
- E.g. keep the weekends for sending out networking messages and system design and the work week for behavioral and leetcode prep.
- You just have to find what permutation works best for you while remembering to keep progressing in all key areas.
- Finding a mentor/accountability partner.

## The Behavioral Interview

- Be honest. Don't fabricate experiences. Interviewers always ask follow-up questions.
- Be a good storyteller. Use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format, if you want.
- For each category, prepare roughly 1-3 experiences. You might find these questions being repeated by your interviewers.
- Show what you've learnt from your experiences, even if they were failures.
- If you're asked a question you don't have an answer to right away, you can ask your interviewer if you can have 1-2 minutes to think about it.

## The Technical Interview

- Questions are kept purposefully vague. It's your job to clarify. Being a good software engineer isn't just about churning out code, you need to be able to do requirements gathering, deal with vague scenarios etc.
- Ask questions. DOn't jump into the question not having clarified any assumptions, corner cases etc.
- Write down test cases, specifically corner/edge cases.
- Communicate effectively! Talk things out, loud!
- Discuss trade-offs, different strategies that you're considering etc.
- If you're stuck, you can ask for help.
- Not every interviewer will allow you to compile your code and see if the test case passes. Always walk through the test cases to make sure they work! You should be confident that your code works.
- If you're nervous about your technical rounds, watch real-life technical interview videos to put yourself at ease.

## Post-Interview Etiquette

- Always thank your recruiter
- If company policy allows, ask them for feedback.
  - Truer for smaller companies, but bigger c ompanies typically have established policies against giving feedback.
- If you still have interviews scheduled with other companies, inform the companies of your decision. Don't waste anyone's time.
- Never shut the door completely. Propose staying connected via LinkedIn for future opportunities

## Compensation & Negotiation

Understand what the compensation structure is. Typical compensation packages are as follows:

- Base Salary: Usually the most difficult to negotiate, but matters the most.
- RSU (Restricted Stock Units): Understand the vesting schedule.
- Yearly Bonus: A sset percentage of your base salary.
- Signing Bonus: Plenty of room to negotiate.

Bonuses are usually pro-rated.


## How to Negotiate - Research

- Do your research about the compensation numbers. Ask your friends, if they're comfortable sharing their packages.
- Ask friends across different companies so you can have a better idea.
- Use resources like levels.fyi. Glassdoor can be unreliable.

## How to Negotiate

- NEVER accept an offer as soon as it's presented
- Your recruiter will likely call you to discuss the compensation package.
  - Jot down the details, thank them, ask them how long you have to accept the offer, and ask them for some time to think about it.
- If asked, NEVER share a number/range. Flip the question on them.
- I got a wide variety of advice in terms of how I should go about negotiating i.e. phone call vs email. Depends on what you're more comfortable with.
- In your follow-up conversation, always thank them for extending the offer to you.
- Have concrete numbers ready, mention any competing offers/deadlines
- Recruiters will be happy if you say you're signing the contract immediately if you get the proposed number.
- You can negotiate different components of your compensation.
- Don't let fear of being told NO stop you from negotiating.
- You can negotiate for both your internships and full-time offers.
