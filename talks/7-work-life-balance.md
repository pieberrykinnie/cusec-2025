## Learning Outcomes

2 Goals:

1. Understand the 4 types of system maintenance.
2. Understand how to apply this to your own work-life balance.

Warning: If you don't schedule time for maintenance, your equipment will schedule it for you.

## Current Self Care Models

- Courrective-Focus: Current discussions around self-care focus on treats, sleep, relaxation, and time away from work. This often does not address preventing issues, or improving as a person.
- Small Scale: A lot of self care tips don't handle long-term issues. Besides sleep and eating better, these tips may not improve your life structurally. It's a lot of band-aids.
- Lack of Diversity: A lot of the tips you may come across for self-care covers the same broad concepts, and may not apply to your specific, unique scenario, or cover your needs as a person.

## Types of Sys. Maintenance

The 4 types of system maintenance, fact of CAPP:

- Corrective: (C)orrective maintenance means to address and attempt to solve immediate problems. This is often what traditional self-care routine are hoping to complete. In SE, Corrective maintenance usually involves diagnostic work, bug fixing, unit testing, or forms of disassembly or reassembly.
- Adaptive: (A)daptive maintenance attempts to address changes to the environment a system is acting within. This is a more "reactive" form of maintenance, and often could include changing code for new operating systems.
- Preventative: (P)reventive maintenance is the first long-term form of maintenance, and it involves preventing future issues from occurring, or past issues from recurring. A common example of this is implementing firewall and anti-virus systems, adding version-control, developing more detailed roadmaps, or improving upon testing routines before final release.
- Perfective: (P)erfective maintenance is the second long-term form, and primarily handles long-term system improvements beyond avoiding problems. More common examples of this would be improving UX design.

## Performing Maintenance

With CAPP well understood, one question remains: "How do we apply this to our lives???"

Let us focus on academic life from this point onwards and seek to apply this to work-life balance in classes, research, projects, and your broad life.

Examples of Each Form

- Corrective:
  - Traditionally: Take a vacation
  - Lessening your schedule when you feel overwhelmed with tasks.
  - Getting more sleep, eating enough, practicing basic self care.
  - Accomplish some work and play in the same day, especially in small chunks.
- Adaptive:
  - Spend time meeting new coworkers.
  - Communicate when you are overwhelmed or when you need more time to complete tasks.
  - Set up a workspace such that you feel comfortable and welcomed.
  - Give yourself time to grow and change
- Preventive:
  - GO TO THERAPY
  - Make a standard of refusing tasks you don't have the time or energy for.
  - Don't think about work when away.
  - Reflect on current difficulties and communicate results.
  - Enforce strict boundaries on what tasks you can and cannot complete, based on your work requirements.
- Perfective:
  - Update your self care routine, such as sleeping more and eating better.
  - Set up a strict schedule for when you work and when you focus on life.
  - Address issues in your life that makes time away from work less rewarding or healing for you.

A Few Simple Rules

- Long != Productive: Just because you worked for 12 hours, doesn't mean you were productive for 12 hours. It is healthy to take breaks, prioritize yourself, and work with purpose and motivation when you are working.
- Prioritize Yourself: If you leave yourself behind, your work will start to suffer, and so will you. You can always get that work done later, but that time with friends and family is limited, not to mention the very real risk of burnout or getting sick.
- Be Efficient: When working, think about how to working better.
