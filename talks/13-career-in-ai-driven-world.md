# Preparing for your career in the New Era of an AI-Driven World

By Edwin Sarmiento

## The rise of automobiles

- There were people taking care of horses, sweeping up horses
- There came a time where an entire industry where jobs were lost because cars were introduced

Lesson #1: Technology will always be a threat to the status quo

- Word processors have replaced typewriters
- What you learn in school will be obsolete when you get out of school
- Uber and taxi, AirBNB and hotel, Amazon and shopping

## First attempt at entrepeneurship

- Started an internet cafe back in 1999
- Banner ad in email for the company Dialpad - could make international long-distance calls for free
- People made fun of it, thinking it was impossible

Lesson #2: You will be ridiculed, bullied, mocked for challenging the status quo

## New inventions

- The people who see the future will be made fun of today
- Robotaxi: Weird, insane, potential billion ethical issues
- Tesla autonomous robot: Natural progression of technology

Lesson #3: You have a choice to keep the status quo even when the whole world has already moved on

- And if so, you're in the wrong place
- I am optimistic: I need to know what I'm up against

## Goal

Get crystal clear on **your** ideal career and lifestyle. Make it as specific and detailed as you possibly can.

- Are you ready to really work in software engineering? Will you be miserable?
- When going on a road, you need to know where you're going
- Need to pack everything, need to check the gas, need to check how fast you're going, neeed to check the status of the vehicle
- If we're doing this for a trip, why not spend so much time in our career?

Action item #2: Become an expert at being a human

- We focus too much on acquiring tech skills
- "The key to success in this age of artifical intelligence is not to be more like machines but to excel at the best of what makes us human."
- "In today's age of artifical intelligence and automation, we humans need to provide value where machines cannot."
- What AI will never replace is community and learning from each other
- There's a billion dollar industry in making "virtual girlfriends"

Action item #3: Take action NOW.

- There may be no tomorrow
- It's not about information; it's about taking action
- Just talking to somebody is action: this week, you became a better communicator
- A small step leading you towards your goal is much better than talking and planning

## A framework for taking

Dream: Pretend nobody's pressuring you, what would it be that you really want to do?

Doesn't matter if it takes decades; make it into a reality

## Q&A

- Do you have a podcast?
  - Maybe
- How did you learn public speaking skills?
  - Introverted, English not first language. How I got good: I just did it. No computer-related education, failed 17 courses in undergrad, no certifications, could not compete with you. Had to do what nobody else wanted to do: go up there and speak. Was it fun? Hell no! Got invited to Microsoft anyway.
- Why did you fail 17 courses?
  - Didn't want to go to school. If I could do the work at a high level without going to school, why would I go to school? While classmates were trying to study, was learning how to write code.
- Why did you stay in university after failing so much?
  - asian. One thing we like about comedy is because we laugh at reality. After getting a degree, I bailed out.
