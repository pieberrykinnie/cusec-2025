# RBC x CUSEC 2025 Workshop

## Objective

The objective of this workshop/challenge is to see the benefits... and possibly detriments... of using AI-powered coding assitants such as GitHub Co-Pilot. 

There are three challenges in three different coding languages, you don't have to know the languages since the coding assistant will be doing **ALL** of the work INCLUDING minor changes. 

For each challenge, you are tasked with prompting GitHub Co-Pilot to do the work for you and you cannot change anything in anyway unless it is done through prompts.

## RULES

You may **ONLY** use GitHub Co-Pilot to generate and fix code. You cannot manually create or fix code. If the response of GitHub Co-Pilot is not what you want, use prompts to correct your code.

**SHOW YOUR PROMPTS**: We'll be checking your prompts to see if they match up with your program. You can copy and paste the responses to your prompts in any place within your program, but everything has to be done through co-pilot. For example, you can split the tasks into smaller steps and put it all together at the end or even try to get it done all at once.
