# What Everyone in Tech Should Know About Teaching and Learning

By Greg Wilson

## Reading Is Weird

- Reading and listening to the same words is bad

## The Magic Number 7 +- 2

- Short-term memory is the bottleneck everything has to go through
- Short-term memory can only hold 7 things
- Bell ran a research: 7 or 8 digits 95% success, 12 digits 55% success -> why phone numbers are as long as they are
- In a sports team, people break up into no more than half a dozen people

## One Thing at a Time

- Bikes without pedals
- Scratch is the best way to teach everyone how to code because it has less cognitive load
- When teaching, teach patterns, so you only know one thing

## Cognitive Load

- When learning new language, need to learn both vocabulary and grammar
- Duolingo exploits by making you only learn grammar

- Intrinsic: What the learning task is supposed to be about - Grammar
- Germane: Extra relevant work (such as retrieving supporting information) - Vocabulary
- Extrinsic: Handling irrelevancies - Fonts

- Doesn't matter what style your codebase is, as long as it's uniform

## Two Ways to Learn

Passive Learning vs. Active Learning

- Read about something - Try it out
- Watch a video - Do exercises
- Attend a lecture - Discuss a topic
- Hear something explained - Try to explain it

Active Learning is Better...but university students report that they prefer passive learning...

- Queen's University Calculus story

## Six Strategies

- Spaced practice
- Interleaving
- Retrieval practice
- Concrete examples
- Elaboration
- Dual coding

### Interleaving

- Randomize study order to  build long-range connections
- And to avoid accidentally training your brain to recall things only in a specific order

Rule #6: Learners are not robots

## Motivation

- Intrinsic: Doing this for my own reasons
- Extrinsic: Doing this because I have to

Neurotypical adults' motivators:
- Positive:
  - Self-Efficacy: I am in control of my own life
  - Utility: This will help me meet my goals
  - Community: People I know are learning this with me
- Negative:
  - Unpredictability: What I do doesn't seem to affect the outcome
  - Unfairness: The teacher plays favorites
  - Indifference: Nobody cares

## Myths

1. Visual/auditory/kinesthetic learning styles are the astrology of teaching
1. Meyers-Briggs Type Indicators are astrology too
1. The Learning Pyramid was made up by an ad agency

## What Next?

- Minecraft (literally)
- The difference between online courses and lectures is you're not learning with others in real-time
