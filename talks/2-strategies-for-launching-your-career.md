# Student to Software Engineer: Strategies for Launching Your Career in Tech

By Matthew Macrae-Mitchell

- Been in university for 7 years, work and study at the same time
- Have 4 years of experience before graduation
- Presentation: Advice you (hopefully) haven't heard before to help you grow as a developer

## Build REAL projects

- Common (true) advice: Build to learn things
- Most projects only represent a small subset of what you're doing
- Internships are just extended interviews for full-time roles: need to show you can present as a full-stack software engineer
- One or more projects on your resume probably look like client-server-database but it's all local
- Need to also maintain projects used by real people
- Skills aren't usually highlighted: Automated Testing, Code Reviews, Observability, Architecture, Cloud Services, CI / CD
- Maintaining a deployed app with real users makes you learn a lot of skills

## Prioritize for breadth

- Reality: In 4 months, you'll probably only finish a few tickets
- Example internship timeline:
  - Month 1: First 2 weeks onboarding and setting up environment, simple tasks
  - Month 2 + 3: Regular work
  - Month 4: Team will want you to stop taking on as much "real" work because you'll be gone in a few weeks
- When you're new, it's easy to get pigeonholed into working on similar tasks
- Consider how your current work will look on your resume to future employers
- Ask to pair with more senior developers on tickets outside your depth
- If you feel your work environment isn't enabling you, talk to your manager in a 1:1
- As a student experience a breadth of:
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Problem spaces / Domains
  - Team & organizational structures

## Consume content to improve technical communication

- A lot of students struggle with Technical Communication
- 100% of hiring processes will have you orally answer technical questions: the maturity of your answers is an indicator of your experience
- How do you improve technical communication when you can't surround yourself with developers?
- Use Dev blogs and conference talks to observe how others communicate technical concepts both orally and in writing.

## You Need a Roadmap

- Use roadmaps to guide your googling, tutorial following, project building, etc
- Checkout roadmap.sh

## Conclusion

1. Build REAL projects (get off localhost)
1. Prioritize for breadth of work
1. Consume content to improve technical communication
