By Nivy Kani

## Optimal Timeline

- Friday Night:
  - Find teammates
  - Write a team charter
  - Brainstorm project ideas
  - Decide on features
  - Make a wireframe
  - Set up repository
- Saturday Morning:
  - Split up the work
  - Learn the new tools
  - Visit company booths
  - Make sure your env works
- Saturday Afternoon:
  - Mid-day progress meeting
  - Ask mentor for help
  - Pivot if needed
  - Attend workshops
- Saturday Evening
  - Focus on finishing the project
- Sunday Morning
  - Fix any last bugs
  - Deploy your project
  - Put together presentation
  - Practice the pitch
  - Celebrate with your team

## One-time investment of your time

- Git and GitHub
- Docker
- Automated CI/CD
- Figma

The most useful skill at a hackathon is front-end skills

- Harder than it looks
- Highly valuable

Also very important are presentation skills

- Learn how to pitch

## Winning Strategies

- Decide on prize categories first
- Decide features based on the demo
- Pay attention to the judging rubric
- Make sure you have a wow-factor
- Do something simple, but do it well
- Review the winning projects and learn from them

**BEWARE**:

- "let's combine the back-end and front-end last": Integrate as early as possible, hardcode on the backend instead of frontend
- "easy, i can do it in 1 hour": Really hard to estimate how long something will take you, have ample time to build features and contigency plans
