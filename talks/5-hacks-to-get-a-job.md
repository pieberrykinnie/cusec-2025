# 10 Hacks to Get a Job & Avert Your (Inevitable) Quarter-Life Crisis

By Zhen Wu

## Hack 1: Judge by Substance, Not by Label

Example Label - Possible Substance:

- Bain & Co management consultant - Changes ppt font colours
- Growth Lead at a YC company - That went nowhere
- GM at another unicorn - Joined at right time
- Built a $1b business unit - In payments, where $1b is normal
- CEO of a startup / raised VC money - That went nowhere, yet
- Machine Learning Developer - Played with OpenAI API
- Career advisor - Never worked as or hired a Dev

Takeaway:

- Labels don't mean shit
- Judge by substance
  - Is the source credible?
  - Is the advice logical?
- Test it and try for yourself

## Hack 2: Getting job = American Idol

Just get 3 YESes from 3 humans who care about different things least of which is your resume and transcript

- The screener: Their job is to filter out the noise, do they know you
- The interviewer: Their job is to interview you, do you know the company and can work on their projects
- The hiring manager

## Hack 3: Ask for help is a secret student buff

And it's a number's game

- Ask 10 people for help
- 8 people ignore you
- 1 person yells at you
- 1 person helps you + changes your life

## Hack 4: Doing > Studying

Example: how we hire software engineers

What we look at before interview (ranked)

- Relevant work experience
- Other work experience (paid)
- Other work experience (unpaid)
- Relevant project (with GitHub codebase)
- Open source projects
- Your own projects
- (We don't look at grades)

What we look for during interview: "Can you get the job done?"

- Can you understand the goal and user context?
- Can you ask the right questions to clarify things?
- Can you ask for help in a helpful way?
- Can you code?
- Can you take feedback well and iterate?
- (Coding is not the only thing - do something AI can't)

## Hack 5: Be lazy, find supply demand gap

- 100,000 applicants fighting for 100 spots: 0.01% win rate
- 100 applicants fighting for 80 spots: 80% win rate

How: Go for the hidden jobs

- Winter / Fall internship (non peak season)
- Out of Canada internship
- Jobs that are not posted
- Less famous startup jobs
- Non coding jobs working with software

## Hack 6: Fuck your dream job

- The concept of a "dream job" is both emotional and detrimental
- Relies on you knowing your preferences as well as options now and in the future
- Before you explore your options, can't assume your dream job will be what gives you fulfillment

## Hack 7: Show up, try things

Student = unfair asymmetric risk, you have nothing to lose

## Hack 8: Know what matters to YOU

(and not the Average Person)

- Just because you get something everyone else wants doesn't mean it'll matter to you

## Hack 9: Follow honesty vector

(if you want life to be easy)

- Every day you wake up, have something that motivates you
- If you do something you don't care about, you won't get it done

## Hack 10: Try vipassana
