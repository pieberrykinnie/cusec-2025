# Emerging Technologies

With Rue & Sophie

## What are the most promising technologies yo usee transforming the next decade and why?

- Sophie: Definitely AI, many interesting research going on in AI (agentic, vision, more computationally efficient).
- Rue: Responsible AI, agentic AI, more niche by Meta is Large Concept Model (vs. Large Language Model)

## What about research?

- Rue: Again, responsible AI, Apple recently released paper about how AI cannot reason. Large concept models might be the next big thing as there's research of it outperforming RAG
- Sophie: Multiple AI, AI safety, diffusion models...

## Any areas where the potential of AI is a little overhyped?

- Sophie: Hot take but improvement of commercial language models haven't been as great, nothing really changed since transformers were introduced, only more and different parameters
- Rue: Everything that exists right now is not needed, the business hype is overblown. AI being in every app decreases efficiency of software and makes everything more painful, had to email customer support to turn it off. Why is AI added to everything when you didn't ask? Wouldn't want AI in an app containing your personal budgeting.

## What skill or knowledge area recommend students for learning AI/ML in undergraduate?

- Rue: Learn the basics of AI/ML. Remove confidence that AI is ever as good as you, your brain is much more complex. If I give you a critical thinking problem, you probably can do it better and explain the thought process better. Learn what's actually happening then go to the fancier side. Don't neglect the other portions of Computer Science, AI is built on so much math, linear algebra, statistics, DSA, automata. Can look at AI in other departments' classes and try them, so you know how AI looks to the end-user model. If you look at them, it's much more useful to understand the pain points than just learning it yourself
- Sophie: It kinds of depend. Different for AI engineer and researcher. Two things to focus on are math and coding. In AI research, requires confidence to trust your algorithm, math can only get you so far. Python and PyTorch are good, for math statistics and linear algebra.

## For Rue, how do you stay up-to-date with recent developments?

- Rue: Internship is so different than day-to-day. Thing with large companies is so many people know about different topics, easy to set up coffee chat to learn about topics. Can go read a white paper of AI, but can go talk with someone else about this. Companies have internal social media that they post about this, or come up to you in lunch, how I learned about Apple paper. Follow people on LinkedIn but follow it strategically. Curate your social media, even make a second account to just follow professors who talk about their research.

## For Sophie, how do you balance between model accuracy and explainability?

- Sophie: Researchers are inclined at understanding things better with an efficiency tradeoff. In healthcare however, people might want to debug to reduce bias

## How do I setup coffee chats without a strong math background?

- Rue: Reach out to people in industry as they're used to it as they talk to people in business more often than not. Read a couple white papers, more accessible than academic research, then find a YouTube video and if you're comfortable, find an academic paper
