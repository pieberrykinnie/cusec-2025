# Landing Internships Panel

## What strategies have you found most effective for standing out?

- Depends on the company, but every experience you do, you take out the most from it that you can. Some students join clubs just to put on your resume and run out of things to talk about.
- There's a lot of luck, the difference between those who are qualified and those who didn't get picked is not as big so don't be too bummed. For middle-tier company, LinkedIn is an underrated resource, network with a lower-level engineer at the company and ask for referral. Getting ahead of the giant pile of resume, LinkedIn is the most effective.
- Increase exposure to different companies through going through a bunch of career fairs, meeting recruiters, to get ahead of the game and put your resume on top of the stack.

## How can students with minimal experience still build a strong resume and portfolio?

- Met many people who transfered into CS and Engineering who came from different degree in big companies. For first/second year, join communities, make projects, personally joined Amazon in third year. Work with them, grow your skills, and keep applying.
- Apply with what your strong suit is, as you're working wiggle into what you actually want to do. Applied as Head of Social Events, nudge a little code into things. Middle with product management in software development internship.
- Lots of advice are building on your own side projects, but you lose motivation on your own. Circumvent is working on projects in hackathons, open source, communities. There are internships specifically for first and second year

## How can you find internship abroad and make most of your time there?

- Challenge self and do AI research at the same time. Highly recommend going to any application portal, sometimes there isn't even one. Go on LinkedIn, find people you find interesting, talk to them, talk about their experience, show you're interested in working there and talk about your skills. Say you wanna work there and if it's possible. Need to make space for yourself, put yourself out there by emailing people.

## Have you secured any of your Co-ops through an unconventional path?

- Something my friend did, she systematically worked through meeting every person at a company to even CEO. Had a full presentation in company-style on a project she wanted to do, even though they weren't hiring interns she got the job. There are extreme things you can do to get internships, lower effort version is reaching out to people on LinkedIn, talking to people whose shoes you want to be in. This only really works if you're interested in that specific company or specific roles, but if you're genuine you can start talking and making a name for yourself.

## How did you secure a full-time role after your internship?

- Realized that the process to get an internship is quite brutal and didn't want that pressure in the final year. Prioritized getting return offers, meeting all the goals extremely quickly, 3-month process but you want to hit your goals in 2 months. After getting a return offer, still interviewed but inevitably returned to the culture that was used to.

## For internships abroad, what if you know the language?

- If you're fluent in it, send a cold email in that language. In my case, reached out to bunch of professors so they knew English quite well. 

## Tailoring resume take less time?

- Had 4 versions of resumes, didn't tailor to each company, had a software, software + ECE, software + leadership + PM. Instead of writing custom cover letter, custom reached out to people on LinkedIn. When did write cover letter, wrote who I am, here's my experience, conclusion, only edited body paragraph for each company so it felt like the whole thing was tailored to them. What are the three types of roles you're applying to, build a resume around that.

## Keep connections going post-internship?

- Usually internships you get a mentor, goal is to foster at least one internship. At the end, ask to add people on WhatsApp or LinkedIn, check on them to ask what they're doing or even ask for references, may feel like a burden but it'll keep them in the loop.
- Would schedule call with each person on the team to ask their life story and know them as a person, very helpful for a remote internship. Throughout the term, made it very easy to navigate and questions answered, also get them more brought in to my growth as an intern. Makes it so at the end of the term, you're not just rushing these networks. At the first week is the most natural time, after that you can wrap it up and stay in touch.
