# From Zero to One: How to Treat Yourself Like A Startup

By Lyn Chen

## Introduction

- club penguin
- Read a very cool book

Brought up Google, Instacart, Amazon:
- Google was the 20th search engine: main pitch was to let people search things and get out as fast as possible
- In startups, it pays to be an excellent student and learn from other mistakes

**Startup**:

"The pursuit of delivering 10x value or higher. The process of reinvention over and over again by learning from the mistakes of others, then making new mistakes." - Lyn Chen

## Journey to Silicon Valley

- In 10th grade, started contemplating future plans
- The "insecure overachiever" persona: decided to just do fun things
- Won a hackathon inadvertently, learned a lot from a judge and fell in love with entrepeneurship
- Set up a lot of coffee chats with potential mentors to learn more
- Built a startup, rolled out products to many places, even spent 5 hours every day in summer to pitch product to passerbys at a store
- Later on built another startup, asked a Google engineer friend to look at product without saying it's hers: got very honest feedback
- Started fundraising, got hundred of applications - moved goal to get people to talk to her instead of seeking those uninterested
- Got into Y Combinator Thiel fellowship. Learned:
1. Need to talk to a lot of people
1. Need to use simple terms
1. Need to create a network of people
- Spoke to 1000 people before getting into Y Combinator
Rule #1 of startup: "A founder's mindset is the courage to state your dream 100 times."

- Focus on getting a 100 people that love you than 1 million people who kinda like you
- When getting a mentor, follow their advice firmly and catch up after the result
- The less you talk about your dream, the less feedback

## Journey to building in education

- Need to invest in people in this era of AI, UX is the most important thing
- Built a DevOps course on freecodecamp, later an initiatve to teach people about AI
- Universities have certain disconnect with cool experience and teaching capability: on us to not resort to mediocricity

Dream: To build an university for 50M people to teach lifelong learning through entrepeneurship

Rule #2 of startup "Ambition in action is treating every quarter like a startup - an opportunity for a bold experiment."

## Learning

- Talk with Peter Thiel:
  - How can you tell if someone is passionate?
  - Ask what they'll be doing in 5 years
  - Passion = learning something obsessively?
- Need to realize you can learn everything you want to, no matter how good you think you are

- Types of Persons:
  - "I" Shape: Expert at one thing
  - "T" Shape: Expert at one thing, knowledgable at many
  - "M" Shape: Expert at many things, knowledgable at others
    - Try having something that pay you and something you're passionate about
